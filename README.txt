# Getting Started Tips

Be aware of these new game mechanics:

    Thirst              Just like hunger, you can now become thirsty. Carry a full bottle or
                        canteen to drink from and keep yourself healthy. YOU CANNOT HEAL WHEN
                        THIRSTY OR HUNGRY. However, you heal much more quickly.

    Temperature         You can now become too hot and too cold. The large globe in the center of
                        your HUD will range from blue to red to indicate temperature (changing to
                        a snowflake or fire when dangerous). You can eventually take damage and
                        die from exposure.

    Seasons             A Minecraft year is defined as being 84 Minecraft days long, with each
                        season taking 21 days.
                        This will cause all the usual changes in temperature, ability to grow crops,
                        precipitation, etc.  Plan your home and travels accordingly.

In addition to the usual things, concentrate on making these items early:

    Lunch Bag:          Using the same bucket recipe with paper will get you a lunch bag. Shift-
                        right-click to open, and then right-click a chest with food in order to grab
                        food you haven't eaten recently. Upgrade to a Lunch Box when you have some
                        iron ingots.

    Bottle:             Since thirst is now a real concern, you'll want to make an ordinary bottle
                        early on so you can drink.  Once you have enough leather, make a Canteen.

    Clay Bucket:        Iron is quite a bit harder to come by in this modpack, but you can make a
                        clay bucket with just plain clay using the same recipe. Fire the bucket in
                        a furnace, and you're ready to go.

    Tin/Copper Tools:   As mentioned, iron is much harder to come by.  Start with tin or copper
                        tools until you're ready to smelt bronze.
